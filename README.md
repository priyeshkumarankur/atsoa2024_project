## Title - Numerical Simulations with PLUTO code
by Priyesh Kumar Tripathi

**Abstract:** Numerical simulations play a crucial role in investigating the dynamical evolution of astrophysical flows, which involve solving a set of highly coupled and non-linear time-dependent partial differential equations by numerical methods that would be expensive or impossible to study using traditional techniques. This project aims to familiarize students with the basics of numerical simulation using a widely popular astrophysical code, PLUTO.

**Prerequisite Software:** Python, C, C++ compilers, openmpi library, paraview
> code
